# DSC106 WI24 Final Project - Akash Juwadi, Sukham Sidhu, and Donald Toggart

Our project is about the difference between GDP and the Gini Coefficient, and the importance of understanding metrics for good data visualizations.

Please note that tooltips may take longer to appear when hovering on a Mac OS computer than on Windows.
